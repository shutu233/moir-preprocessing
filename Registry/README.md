1. `shift_rattle` function: doing registry to bilayer (shift the bottom layer of two layers) return: structure after registry
2. `shift_1layer_xx.py`: main code. At the same time, it saved all the structures after registry + relaxation.
### examples: registry results of different systems (simple, complex)
### interlayer_intralayer:
1. `intra_interEng` function: return intralayer energy, interlayer energy and total energy before & after relaxation. Containing some bugs.
2. `intra_interEng_bi` function: same function, debug by using BilayerCalculator.
3. `.ipynb`: example
